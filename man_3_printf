.TH _PRINTF 3 "November 2024" "1.0" "Custom Printf Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR _printf ()
function produces output according to a
.I format
as described below.
The function writes output to
.BR stdout ,
the standard output stream.
.PP
The
.BR _printf ()
function writes the output under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.SS Return value
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value (-1) is returned.
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string composed of zero or more directives:
ordinary characters (not
.BR % ),
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications,
each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
.PP
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character
.BR % ,
and ends with a
.IR "conversion specifier" .
.SS Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B c
The
.I int
argument is converted to an
.IR "unsigned char" ,
and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The
.I "const char *"
argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer
to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including)
a terminating null byte ('\\0'). If the argument is NULL, the string "(null)"
is printed instead.
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
specification is '%%'.
.TP
.BR d ", " i
The
.I int
argument is converted to signed decimal notation. Negative numbers are
preceded by a minus sign ('-').
.SH EXAMPLES
To print a simple message:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("Hello, World!\\n");
.EE
.in
.PP
To print a formatted message with multiple specifiers:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\\n", "Alice", 25);
.EE
.in
.PP
To print a character and a percentage:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
_printf("Grade: %c (100%%)\\n", 'A');
.EE
.in
.SH NOTES
The
.BR _printf ()
function does not handle:
.IP \(bu 2
Flag characters (+, -, 0, #, space)
.IP \(bu
Field width
.IP \(bu
Precision
.IP \(bu
Length modifiers (l, ll, h, hh, etc.)
.IP \(bu
Other conversion specifiers (u, o, x, X, p, etc.)
.PP
For edge cases not explicitly described, the behavior matches that of the
standard
.BR printf (3)
function.
.SH BUGS
Unknown conversion specifiers are printed as-is, including the % character.
